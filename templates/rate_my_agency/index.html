		<h2>Top rated agencies:</h2>
		Should have similar code to search by city above, but cannot implement currently as we don't have
		the rating system working yet. Thinking we should have a field called "approval" in the Agency model,
		so as to avoid confusion with <strong>individual</strong> user ratings? This would just be a percentage
		of ratings which were likes. Not sure exact logistics of that yet though - maybe we should ask the tutor.<br>

		<h2>Busiest Agencies</h2>
		We got negative feedback on "agencies to avoid" on the design spec, so I thought we could replace it with
			something like this, based on how many comments a page has for example. Can discuss on Thursday.<br>
